First, we created a conceptual model that highlights the necessary inputs and parameters to determine our output. Our inputs were

![Conceptual model for almond yield](/almond_model.png){#id .class width="50%" height="50%"}

Next, we load in our packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

We also need to load in the climate data used in our almond yield prediction

```{r}
climate_data <- read_table(here("data", "clim.txt")) %>% clean_names()
```

Now we build our model...

```{r}
# Create our almond yield function
almond_yield <- function(climate_data, Tn1 = -0.015, Tn2 = -0.0046, P1 = -0.07, P2 = 0.0043, i = 0.28) {
  
  # Create a data frame with minimum February temperature for joining (We chose to use February temp because we assumed frost would have a negative effect on almond production)
  feb_temp <- climate_data %>%
    filter(month == 2) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(min_feb_temp_c = min(tmin_c, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") 
  
  # Create a data frame with total January precipitation for joining (We chose to use January precipitation because precipitation at time of harvest likely had less effect on production)
  jan_p <- climate_data %>%
    filter(month == 1) %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    summarize(jan_precip = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop") 
  
  # Join the precip and temp data for our climate data
  climate_data_jan_feb <- left_join(feb_temp, jan_p, by = "year")
  
  # Compute yield for each year
  climate_data_jan_feb <- climate_data_jan_feb %>%
    mutate(yield = Tn1 *    min_feb_temp_c + Tn2 * min_feb_temp_c^2 + P1 * jan_precip + P2 * jan_precip^2 + i)
  
  
  
  # Return max, min, and mean almond yields
  return(list(
    max_yield = max(climate_data_jan_feb$yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_yield = min(climate_data_jan_feb$yield, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_yield = mean(climate_data_jan_feb$yield, na.rm = TRUE)
  ))
}
```

Finally, we check our model with the original climate data!

```{r}
almond_yield(climate_data)
```

Our final values were max_yield = 1920.308, min_yield = -0.02682371, mean_yield = 181.759! :)
